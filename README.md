This project is a program designed to read an error log (this is the included text file). When started, the program will give the user a selection menu. The user 
will be given the selection of, display the error log file, display lines with error, display lines with statistics, display lines with info, and display the IP
address for lines that contain info. Again with my functions and main program, I added error handling. What is unique about this program is the part where it
finds the IP address. That was the most difficult to code.
